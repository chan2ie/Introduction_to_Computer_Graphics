## HW2 (2D Modeling Transformation)
![sampleImage](https://i.ibb.co/ccGKT8r/Graphics-HW1.gif)
This program is based on an example program provided in the class. The code I wrote myself and project document is located described below.

In this project, I created different dynamic effects using OpenGL API functions. Different creative dynamic effects were created for six objects: airplanes, shirts, houses, cocktails, and hats, and one racing car model I modeled myself.
## HW3 (Understanding 3D Viewing)

In this project, I experienced modeling transformation, viewing transformation and projection transformation in 3d space using OpenGL API functions. I drew the floor and world coordinate system, and placed 5 still objects and 4 moving objects. Then, I created 5 different cameras and added translation, rotation and zoom in/out fuction to 5th camera.

This repository is created to archive my past works. I welcome junior students who take the same class to refer to my codes. However, I strongly oppose copying it and I am not responsible for any disadvantages you might get from copying it.
